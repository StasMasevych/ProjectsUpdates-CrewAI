    Use the following Google Boolean search operators to refine search queries:  
    Basic Operators:  
     `AND` → Requires both terms (e.g., `solar AND wind`).  
     `OR` → Includes either term (e.g., `solar OR wind`).  
     `-` (Minus) → Excludes a term (e.g., `renewable energy -solar`).  
     `""` (Quotes) → Searches for exact phrases (e.g., `"renewable energy project"`).  
     `*` (Wildcard) → Acts as a placeholder (e.g., `"solar * technology"`).  
     `()` (Parentheses) → Groups terms logically (e.g., `(solar OR wind) AND project`).  

    Domain & URL Filtering:  
     `site:` → Searches within a specific domain (e.g., `site:gov renewable energy`).  
     `inurl:` → Finds keywords in URLs (e.g., `inurl:renewable`).  
     `allinurl:` → Requires all words in the URL (e.g., `allinurl:solar energy project`).  

    Title & Content Targeting:  
     `intitle:` → Finds pages with the keyword in the title (e.g., `intitle:"solar project"`).  
     `allintitle:` → Requires all words in the title (e.g., `allintitle:solar wind energy`).  

    Related & Cached Pages:  
     `related:` → Finds similar websites (e.g., `related:energy.gov`).  
     `cache:` → Views a cached version of a site (e.g., `cache:energy.gov`).  

    Date Filtering:  
     `before:` & `after:` → Filters results by date (e.g., `solar energy project after:2021`).  

    ⚡ Example Query:  
    Find government reports on wind energy projects (PDFs from the last 3 years):**  
    `wind energy project site:gov filetype:pdf after:2025`
